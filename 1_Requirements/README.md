## Introduction

## Stock Inventory System

This project is a console application using the C programming language. This project is compiled in visual stdio code using GCC compiler. In this cosole application you can do basic Stock Inventory System tasks like adding the new components, view components list availability , delete components, update components list, etc., .

# 4W's and 1'H

### *Who:*

This Project can be used by Whole sale & Retail Shopkeepers. This system will make their work simple.

### *What:*

Adding, Deleting, viewing and searching of components can be done by this project without manual effort of the human.

### *When:*

When there is need to added to new component list and deleting the out of stock by shopkeeper.

### *Where:*

This system is used in Retail & Wholesale shopkeers to analyze the stock.

### *How:*

System design is a solution for how to approach to the creation of a new system. It translates system requirements into ways by which they can be made operational. It is a translational from a user oriented document to a document oriented programmers. For that, it provides the understanding and procedural details necessary for the implementation. Here UML diagrams are used to supplement the working of the new system. The system thus made should be reliable, durable and above all should have least possible maintenance costs.

# SWOT Analysis

*SWOT*	|*Analysis* |
|--------|-----------|
|Strength	| This project involves adding and maintaining Components records. Reduction of manual work. Easy to use. Removes manual process of calculating and analyzing the stock to save time and effort.|           
|Weakness	| Program can breakdown and give false results. Online systems require good connection. Limits the knowledge of the user. Open-source systems stores data on computer hardware. This increases the risk of data loss.|
|Opportunity	| Mobile application can be developed. Helps Retail & Wholesale shopkeepers during these pandemic times.|
|Threat	| Since these information are accessible by everyone we need to apply another level of security model to apply for user access. User authentication need to be implemented.|
